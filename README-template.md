## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I chose to use HMTL 5 and CSS to complete this challenge. I enjoyed playing with Flexbox to move the QR Card to the middle of the page.

Things to remember for next time:
```css
body {
min-height: 100vh;
  width: 100%;
  }
```
This allowed me to make the body element the full desktop size and move the section element into the middle.

I used the design outlines to create CSS variables:

```css
:root {
  --White: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --Light-gray: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  --Grayish-blue: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
  --Dark-blue: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
  --font: "Outfit", sans-serif;
}
```

### Continued development

There are many areas of CSS I am not 100% secure on, and look forward to trying some more Frontend Mentor challenges to see how I get on!
